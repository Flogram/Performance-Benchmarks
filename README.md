# Performance-Benchmarks

Performance benchmarks comparing code written in Flogram to other languages

## Steps

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/flogram/performance-benchmarks.git
```

2. Move into the directory

```
cd performance-benchmarks
```

3. Install all necessary dependencies

```
npm install
```

4. Run all benchmarks by using this commmand:

```
npm run test
```

5. If you move to the Samples folder, you will find subfolders. Every subfolder is a different benchmark. Heading inside, you should find a Flogram and C version of the program. There will also be a `results.txt` containing performance numbers for both languages.
